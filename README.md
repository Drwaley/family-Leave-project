## Introduction

The family leave report addresses how maternity and paternity leave are paid across industries. Also, it beamed light into the industries with unpaid maternity and paternity leave. 

The report revealed that the technology industry is the highest paid for paternity and maternity and unpaid maternity and paternity leaves. The pharmaceutical & drug store and finance Diversified industry reached the top 3 and 5 of unpaid and paid paternity leave respectively.
The healthcare industry and Business industries did so badly in family leave policies.

## Data Description

 The data set contains 1601 rows and 6 columns. It included the number of companies and industries is 1600 and 186 respectively. The data set was sourced from [Maven Analytics](mavenanalytics.io)

I cleaned the data by removing the irrelevant columns ( for example, “ID column”) and changing the data type to the whole number. I noticed the columns contained an error, I fixed that by replacing the null (i.e N\A as represented in the data) to “0”, using replace value function.


## Tools/ skill set used

- Data cleaning: Power Query editor for power Bi

Problem statements

- What is the top 5 industry with the highest paid maternity leave?
- What is the top 5 industry with the highest unpaid maternity leave?
- What industry has the highest-paid paternity leave?
- What industry has the highest unpaid paternity leave?


## The Analysis Overview

I represented the following visuals by card:

- Sum of paid maternity leave =17463
- Sum of unpaid maternity leave = 9902
- Sum of paid paternity leave = 2118
- Sum of unpaid paternity leave = 495


I created two slicers for filtering the industry and the companies.

I used the clustered bar chart to visualize the Top five industries that grant paid maternity and paternity leave. A Donut chart was used to show the percentage of the Top 5 industries with unpaid maternity leave. A stacked column chart represented the industry with unpaid paternity leave. 

The matrix table showed the popular brands and their family leave counts. This table featured companies like; **Google, Coca-Cola, LinkedIn, Twitter, Netflix, Silicon Valley Bank, Goldman Sachs, etc.** finally, a line chart was used to represent the count of unpaid paternity leave by paid paternity leave.


## Insights

- The Count of Paid Maternity Leave was highest for Technology: Software at 160, followed by Technology: Consumer Internet and Consulting Services.
- Technology: Software accounted for 43.84% of the Count of Paid Maternity Leave.
- Technology; consumer internet has the highest count of Paid Paternity leave at 192 followed by Technology; software and Finance Diversified.
- The average paid paternity leave by technology; consumer internet is 3.92

## RECOMMENDATION

- The healthcare industry should take family leave more seriously as it's rather surprising they're not in the top 5 for both paternity and Maternity leave.

- Men's life matters; companies across all industries should grant men paid leave to perform their duties as the head of the family.
